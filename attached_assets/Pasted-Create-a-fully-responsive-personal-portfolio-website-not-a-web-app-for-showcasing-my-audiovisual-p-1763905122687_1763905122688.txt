Create a fully responsive personal portfolio website (not a web app) for showcasing my audiovisual post-production work. The output must be a complete static website compatible with GitHub Pages, using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (no backend frameworks, no build tools, no dependencies like React, Vue, Angular, or Node-based bundlers). Everything must run client-side.

Requirements:

1. Purpose & Style

The website should serve as a clean, modern audiovisual post-production portfolio.

Aesthetic: cinematic, minimalistic, dark theme with subtle neon accents.

Smooth transitions and micro-animations (CSS only or lightweight JS).

Fully responsive layout for desktop, tablet, and mobile.

2. Pages/Sections

Create a single-page layout with smooth scrolling and the following sections:

Hero Section

Full-screen background image or video.

My name and profession: "Audiovisual Post-Production Artist".

A call-to-action button: "View My Work" that scrolls to the portfolio section.

About Section

Space for a profile picture.

A short biography.

Skills list (color grading, VFX, editing, motion graphics, compositing, etc.).

Portfolio Section

Grid or gallery of project thumbnails.

Each project should open a modal/lightbox with:

Embedded video (YouTube/Vimeo links allowed).

Project description.

Tags (e.g., VFX, color grading, editing, motion graphics).

Contact Section

Contact form (client-side only).

Email link.

Social media icons (Instagram, Vimeo, YouTube, LinkedIn, etc.).

Footer

Copyright notice.

GitHub link.

3. Technical Requirements

Must work flawlessly on GitHub Pages, meaning:

Use only static files: index.html, style.css, script.js.

No server-side code.

No absolute paths—use only relative paths.

Should not require any build process.

4. Code Quality

Clean, semantic HTML.

Organized CSS with variables for theme colors.

Lightweight vanilla JavaScript only.

Include comments explaining important sections.

5. Delivery Format

Provide:

index.html

style.css

script.js

A folder structure ready to upload to a GitHub Pages repository.
